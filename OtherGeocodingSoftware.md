Geolocalization of contents is a fascinating phenomenon which is now growing quickly.

If GPicSync doesn't suit your needs or you want to explore other paths you'll find here a a list of other geocoding/geotagging software.

If you know others (preferably Open Source or freeware) and what is interesting or particular about them please let me know so I can add them to the list. Note that I didn't test most of them so use them carefully and make backups.
