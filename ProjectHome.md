  * Support elevation data if present in the tracklog
  * create a Google Earth KML file to directly visualize the geocoded photos and track in Google Earth
  * create a Google Maps file to publish your pictures and track on the web [(more)](GoogleMapsExport.md)
  * Automatically associate audio or video files in Google Earth and Google Maps
  * create a Google Earth KMZ file (containing your geolocalized pictures and tracklog).
  * add additional [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) and 'geotagged' metadata (for automatic tagging in Flickr for example) and create an automatic IPTC caption [(more)](GeonamesMetadata.md)
  * manually write latitude/longitude in a picture EXIF or a selection of photos
  * handy tools integrated (Time correction tool, EXIF reader, GPX inspector, rename pictures with date/location,)

Thanks for all the [contribution/feedback](http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/wiki/Contributions) and for the [translations](http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/wiki/Translations)!

GPicSync also use two great Free Software tools in his back-end: [EXIFTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) and [GPSbabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org/).

I began developing GPicSync as I didn't find any Open Source geocoding software with a graphical interface. GPicSync also provide original features like the [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) meta-data and flights mods.
You can find here an actualized list of [other geocoding software](http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/wiki/OtherGeocodingSoftware).
