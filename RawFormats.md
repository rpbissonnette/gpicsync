You can find here a list of supported RAW formats.

Since GPicSync use [EXIFTool](http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) in its backend, RAW formats for which EXIFTool have read/write capabilities are (or could be) added to GPicSync.

RAW formats which should work for geocoding : arw, cr2, crw, nef, pef, raw, rw2, orf, dng, raf, mrw

Please not that the preview thumbnail in GPicSync interface is not available for RAW formats.

If you have an issue or question about RAW format you can send me a mail [here](http://francois.schnell.free.fr/fxschnellgmail.png) with one of your picture for testing (up to 20 Mo per mail).
